### Frontend
-make website responsive (as some custom css is not)

### backend

-remove captchas, annoying for users, and figure out how to implement honeypot with WTF forms  (so website is still secure, put less annoying to acces for users)

- change the SSL certificates for https connection  Werkzeug, support the use of on-the-fly certificates, which are useful to get an app running for testing and developing purposes, but not ideal in the final project

- create another db where users can store their previosuly identified plants and any info on them. 
Reason this functionality was omitted befiore was because as storing BLOBs and strings together in the same sqlite3 databse could lead to performance issuses)
        It might be ideal switching to a no sql db like MONgodb if also storing images.

-once db is impleemnted each user should have their own upload folder, so threading and locksshould not be needed any more as there won't be one single folder anymore

- once above changes have been implemented, start the unit testing of the application.
